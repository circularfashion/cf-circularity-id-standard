## Description
The circularity.ID Open Data Standard describes essential digital product data for clothing and textiles to enable circular economy and recyclability in the fashion industry. Products identifiable with the circularity.ID Open Data Standard make the entire story of a product and its material components accessible and enable circular use and end-of-life phase on the data level.

## Objective & Scope
The circularity.ID Open Data Standard is intended for use in the fashion industry for the labelling, identification and storing of digital product data, optimising products for a circular economy. It is specifically targeting the circularity and recyclability of textiles, and ultimately designed for the potential of fibre-to-fibre recycling.

In short, the circularity.ID can ensure that:
1) Information on essential material and chemical components is assessed, stored and accessible 
2) Product data is automatically recognised by software at sorting facilities
3) Products are matched to appropriate recyclers, to be recyclable to best knowledge and method according to the current state of technology at end-of-life
4) Essential product information is available to consumers to enable longevity and multiple use cycles for a product, e.g through redesign and resell services.

## Format

circularity.ID ODS is split into immutable product data including material and chemical components, and a mutable set of data that contains product information such as product images, description, sustainability consumer information and service offers in json format.
