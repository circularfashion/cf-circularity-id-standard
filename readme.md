## Description
The circularity.ID Open Data Standard describes essential digital product data for clothing and textiles to enable circular economy and recyclability in the fashion industry. Products identifiable with the circularity.ID Open Data Standard make the entire story of a product and its material components accessible and enable circular use and end-of-life phase on the data level.

## Objective & Scope
The circularity.ID Open Data Standard is intended for use in the fashion industry for the labelling, identification and storing of digital product data, optimising products for a circular economy. It is specifically targeting the circularity and recyclability of textiles, and ultimately designed for the potential of fibre-to-fibre recycling.

In short, the circularity.ID Open Data Standard can ensure that:
1) Information on essential material and chemical components is assessed, stored and accessible 
2) Product data is automatically inteoperable with specific software at sorting facilities
3) Products can be matched to appropriate recyclers, to be recyclable to best knowledge and method according to the current state of technology at end-of-life with software that uses the circularity.ID Oen Data Standard
4) Essential product information can be made available to consumers to enable longevity and multiple use cycles for a product, e.g through redesign and resell services.
